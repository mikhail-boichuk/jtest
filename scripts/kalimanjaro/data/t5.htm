<H2>Fill-Out Form Example #1

This is a very simple fill-out form example. <P>
 
 
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/cgi-bin/post_query.exe">
 
 
A single text entry field goes here: <INPUT NAME="entry"> 
<P> 
 
Note that it has no default value. <P> 

 
To submit the query, press this button: <INPUT TYPE="submit" 
VALUE="Submit Query">. <P> 
 
</FORM> 
 
That's it. <P> 
 
Things you may want to note: <P> 
 
<UL> 
<LI> Characters like "&amp;", "%", and "$" in the text typed into the 
     text entry field are automatically escaped (into hex form: a 
     percent sign followed by a two-digit hex value corresponding to 
     the ASCII value of the character) when the query is constructed. 
     For example, the string "&amp;%$" becomes "%26%25%24". 
<LI> By default, an <CODE>INPUT</CODE> tag corresponds to a text entry 
     field.  The <CODE>TYPE</CODE> attribute lets you change this -- 
     the "submit" type indicates a special pushbutton that causes the 
     query to be submitted when it's pushed.  Other types are 
     demonstrated in the other examples. 
<LI> Because this fill-out form contains only a single text entry 
     field, the query can be submitted by pressing return in the text 
     entry field (as well as by pressing the "Submit Query" button).
