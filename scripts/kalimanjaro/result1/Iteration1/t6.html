This is another fill-out form example, with multiple text entry 
fields. <P> 
 
<p> 
 
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/cgi-bin/post_query.exe"> 
 
The first text entry field goes here: <INPUT NAME="entry1"> <P> 
 
The second text entry field goes here: <INPUT NAME="entry2"> <P> 
 
The third text entry field goes here: <INPUT NAME="entry3"> <P> 
 
To submit the query, press this button: <INPUT TYPE="submit" 
VALUE="Submit Query">. <P> 
 
</FORM> 
 
<p> <P> 
 
Things you may want to note: <P> 
 
<UL> 
<LI> Each text entry field is given a distinct <CODE>NAME</CODE> 
     attribute. 
<LI> The query that results from this form looks like this: 
     "?entry1=blah&amp;entry2=blargh&amp;entry3=blorf" (assuming "blah" 
     had been typed into the first field, "blargh" into the second, 
     and "blorf" into the third). 
<LI> If nothing is typed into any of the fields, the corresponding 
     "name=value" pairs will still be present in the query, with the 
     value simply absent.  So, if you type "blah" into the first field 
     and "blorf" into the third but nothing into the second, the query 
     is "?entry1=blah&amp;entry2=&amp;entry3=blorf". 
</UL>
